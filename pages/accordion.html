                    <h3>Microsoft Windows Media Player</h3>
                    <p>Windows Media Player Playlist (WPL) is a computer file format
                         that keeps multimedia playlists for video and audio 
                         collections. It is an owned file format utilized in 
                         Microsoft Windows Media Player versions 9 to 12. The 
                         fundamentals of WPL files are represented in XML format. 
                         These .WPL files can be accessed and utilized by the 
                         Nullsoft Winamp Media Player 5.6 application version as 
                         well as the Roxio Creator 2012 program. WPL files are also 
                         known as Windows Media Player playlist files, which are 
                         indicated by the Microsoft Windows Media Player or the 
                         other media players with support for WPL files as reference 
                         data when users open these playlist files and begin to access 
                         the content stored in it. The top-level aspect specifies that
                          the file's elements go after the Synchronized Multimedia 
                          Integration Language (SMIL) structure. The information 
                          contained in these WPL files are directory locations to 
                          the video files and audio content chose by the creator 
                          of the .WPL file, this enables the media player application 
                          to quickly and easily find and play the video and audio 
                          content from their directory locations.
